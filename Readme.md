Hi, it's cool that you're taking a look at my configs and such.
It's not a framework or anything and I've been stripping down the dependencies (for example oh-my-zsh, rake, vim plugins and others) so that the configs stay as small as possible.

If you want to use them though....

### You'll need this:

- git
- make

#### Tools

Here's a list of tools I can't work without:

- tmux (latest)
- Bash
- weechat
- i3

#### Editors

- Vim - configs are in [DotVim repo](https://github.com/vivienschilis/DotVim)

#### Programming languages I use

- Ruby
- Shell
- Go
- Scheme


### How to setup (once you got the stuff above)

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:lukaszkorecki/DotFiles.git .DotFiles # it HAS to be .DotFiles
    cd .DotFiles
    make setup
